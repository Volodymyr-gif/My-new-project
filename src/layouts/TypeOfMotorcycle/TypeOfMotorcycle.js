                        <h2>Adventure Touring Bikes / Dual Sports:</h2>
                        <p>Adventure touring bikes and dual sports bikes are designed to be ready for anything—be it
                            tarmac, gravel, or trail riding. Their look is a cross between a traditional touring
                            bike
                            and a dirt bike.</p>
                    </div>


                    <div>
                        <h2>Choppers:</h2>
                        <p>Epitomized by the Harley-Davidson Panhead in the film "Easy Rider," choppers tend to have
                            extremely raked forks, reclined seats, and lots of showy chrome. Famous choppers include the
                            Intel/Orange County Choppers Concept Bike, the Big Bear Choppers Merc Rigid, and just about
                            every custom bike by Guilty Customs and Orange County Choppers.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h2>Cruisers:</h2>
                        <p>Cruisers are like sedate choppers—their fork rake is less extreme, and they're designed for
                            laid-back riding. Cruisers have come to exemplify a typically American image, and exude an
                            air of cool style.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h2>Power Cruisers:</h2>
                        <p>A variant of regular cruisers, power cruisers feature more power and offer a more aggressive
                            riding experience. Power cruisers often inherit high performance characteristics from their
                            sport bike stablemates, and they boast thick rear tires, large exhaust pipes, and low ground
                            clearances.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h2>Dirt Bikes:</h2>
                        <p>Dirt bikes generally refer to motorcycles designed for off-road riding. They typically
                            feature knobby tires, long suspension travel, and minimalistic frames and bodywork. Variants
                            of dirt bike designs compete in Enduro, Motocross, and Trials events, among others.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h2>Enduro Bikes:</h2>
                        <p>Designed for long distance off-road competitions, Enduro bikes are usually equipped with
                            headlights and taillights for nighttime riding, and can be outfitted with timers and roll
                            chart reading devices that aid riders with the sport's navigation and timekeeping
                            requirements. Enduro bikes are not only expected to traverse difficult terrain, they are
                            required to stand up to the rigors of hours of abuse.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h2>Motocross Bikes:</h2>
                        <p>Motocross bikes are dirtbikes designed to compete in outdoor motocross events, which feature
                            terrain that includes tight turns and jumps. These bikes typically run outdoor courses,
                            while supermotos are designed for a mixture of off-road and road surfaces. Supercross riders
                            compete in indoor arenas.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h2>Naked Bikes:</h2>
                        <p>Naked bikes recall British motorcycles of the sixties, and lack bodywork or fairings that
                            would normally hide their engines and inner workings. Naked bikes are essentially sport
                            bikes without bodywork.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h2>Scooters:</h2>
                        <p>Scooters are small, lightweight bikes powered by engines that typically range from 50cc to
                            250cc in displacement. They feature step-through designs and bodywork that shields riders
                            from messy engine parts. If you're looking for an easy, economical way to get around town or
                            commute, check out the following scooters:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Yamaha Vino Classic</li>

                                <li>Yamaha C3 Base</li>
                                <li>Honda Ruckus</li>
                                <li>Yamaha Zuma</li>
                                <li>Aprilia Scarabeo 100</li>
                                <li>Vespa S 150</li>

                                <li>Honda Reflex Sport</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <h2>Power Scooters:</h2>
                        <p>Power scooters are a relatively new category of motorbike, in which a large motor is
                            incorporated into the chassis of a seemingly innocuous scooter. They are typically used for
                            commuting, and their step-through bodies and enclosed mechanical parts prevent riders from
                            staining or excessively wrinkling their clothes. They pack just a little more oomph than
                            regular scooters. Here is a good selection of options:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Yamaha Majesty 400</li>
                                <li>Suzuki Burgman 400</li>
                                <li>KYMCO Xciting 50</li>
                                <li>Aprilia Scarabeo 500 I.E.</li>
                                <li>KYMCO Xciting 500 Ri</li>
                                <li>Honda Silver Wing ABS</li>
                                <li>Suzuki Burgman 650 Executive</li>
                                <li>Yamaha TMAX</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h2>Sport Bikes:</h2>
                        <p>Most sport bikes are intended to be ready for high-performance track duty, as well as street
                            riding. Here is a selection of popular sport bikes:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Kawasaki Ninja 250R</li>

                        <h2>Supermoto Bikes:</h2>
                        <p>Based on race machines that compete on a combination of paved and unpaved surfaces, supermoto
                            bikes possess both off-road characteristics such as deep suspension travel and on-road
                            features such as road tires and bodywork reminiscent of so-called "street fighter" bikes.
                            Supermotos require a unique riding style, which involves sliding the bike and using the
                            rider's boots to leverage balance and traction.</p>

                        <h2>Touring Bikes:</h2>
                        <p>Touring bikes are made for long-distance riding, and include features that rival those of
                            many automobiles, including electronically adjustable suspension, heated grips, intercom
                            systems, backrests, large windscreens, and creature comforts such as satellite radios and
                            navigation systems.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h2>Trials Bikes:</h2>
                        <p>These specialized competition bikes are tailor-made for trials events in which motorcycles
                            are maneuvered around natural or man-made obstacles. Extremely lightweight, trials bikes
                            lack seats and feature stiffer suspension than most dirt bikes. Trials competitions require
                            highly skilled riding, and riders are penalized if their feet touch the ground.</p>
