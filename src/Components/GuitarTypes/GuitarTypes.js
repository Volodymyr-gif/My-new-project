                <strong>There are 6 basic type of guitar : </strong> <br/>
                <h2>1.Acoustic Guitar : </h2> <br/>
                <p>
                    This is the type of guitar most people are familiar with.Acoustic guitars have hollow bodies which
                    amplify the sound of the strings acoustically. They are usually made of wood, have six strings.
                </p>
                <h2>2.Electro-acoustic Guitar : </h2> <br/>
                <p>
                    Electro-acoustic guitars are acoustic guitars that have a ‘pick-up’ (basically, a microphone) built
                    into them so they can be plugged into an amplifier or a PA system.This is a way of ‘connecting’ an
                    acoustic guitar up to an amp to make it louder.
                </p>
                <h2>3.Semi-acoustic Guitar : </h2> <br/>
                <p>
                    Semi-acoustic guitars (sometimes also called ‘hollow bodied electric guitars’) occupy something of a
                    middle-ground between acoustic guitars and electric guitars.They’re thin and compact like electric
                    guitars, but have hollow bodies like acoustic guitars.
                </p>
                <h2>4.Electric Guitar : </h2> <br/>
                <p>
                    Unlike the previous guitars, these guitars have solid bodies and as such, produce very little in the
                    way of sound unless they’re plugged into an amplifier.If you want to play electric guitar you will
                    need an amp.Electric guitars come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some of the most iconic are: the
                    Gibson Les Paul, the Fender Stratocaster and the Fender Telecaster.Like the acoustic guitar,
                    electric guitars are usually made of wood and usually have six strings, though there are twelve
                    string versions available.
                </p>
                <h2>5.Bass Guitar : </h2> <br/>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time, being the bass player in a band meant lugging a huge double-bass as seen in
                    orchestras and jazz bands to and from practice.types of guitar electro. Thankfully, the good folks
                    at
                    Fender eventually came out with a guitar version of the bass that, among other things was a lot more
                    portable than its predecessor. Types of guitars bassistUnlike regular guitars, bass guitars usually
                    only have four strings, and they’re big, thick strings that produce a big, thick sound.Bass sounds
                    deep and low.
                    Earth-shaking!

                            <p>
                                Mandolins are a bit like strummed violins, in that they are tuned the same way, albeit
                                with double the number of stings, but they are strummed like guitars rather than played
                                with a
                                bow.They have a very bright, trebly sound and are popular in styles of music like folk.

                            <p>
                                Banjos have five strings that are usually tuned to an open G chord. Instead of having a
                                soundhole like a guitar, a banjo has a drum for a body.Banjos are all treble and no
                                bass, giving
                                them a very twangy top heavy sound. They’re very popular in styles of music such as
                                folk, bluegrass
                                and country.

                            <p>
                                Ukuleles are small Hawaiian instruments with four strings that look a lot
                                like miniature guitars. Like the mandolin and the banjo, a uke produces a very trebly,
                                delicate,
                                ‘twinkly’ sound.They’re ideal for people who want to play and/or write songs, but find
                                guitars to be
                                a bit big for them.
